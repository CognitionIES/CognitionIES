# CognitionIES Engineering  

I'm a developer at **CognitionIES**, working on small but useful tools to remove everyday hurdles, automate repetitive work, and make things run a bit smoother across teams.

## Pinned Repositories  

### [TeamSync](https://github.com/CognitionIES/TeamSync)  
Real-time project coordination platform.  
Keeps team tasks synced, roles organized, and progress tracked automatically — reducing the need for manual updates or check-ins.  
**TypeScript • React • WebSocket • PostgreSQL**

### [hr-attendance-real](https://github.com/CognitionIES/hr-attendance-real)  
A flexible attendance reporting system for HR.

### [Highlight-Duplicates](https://github.com/CognitionIES/Highlight-Duplicates)  
**File Pair Checker for P&ID Line Lists**  
Users upload Excel or CSV files containing file numbers.  
Normally, each file should exist twice — once with a `.upvc` extension and once with `.upvf`.  
This tool identifies missing pairs and highlights which extensions or files are incomplete.  

- Supports `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` formats  
- Highlights missing or unmatched file pairs  
- Runs fully in-browser — no setup, no install  

**TypeScript • File Parsing • DOM**
